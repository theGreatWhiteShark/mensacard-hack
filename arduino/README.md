The code in this folder will hook you up with 

- all the libraries you need to deploy a NFC shield using an Arduino
- two scripts testing both the Arduino and it's NFC shield
- a copy of the [Arduino-mode](https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode) to deploy your code via Emacs.

For a detailed guide about developing Arduino code using Emacs, check out the [third part](https://thegreatwhiteshark.tech.blog/2017/02/20/mensacard-hack-pt-iii-arduino-and-conclusion/) of my Mensacard Hack blog post.
